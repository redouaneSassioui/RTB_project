# RTB_project
In this project is, we implemented a RTB sumilator using IpinYou public data set. The simulator has the following component:
1- Configuration file: it is an XML file in wich you define how many DSPs you want to simulate, for each dsp which campaigns it manages and for each campaign you have to define its budget and bidding function. Finaly you define the parameters of the bidding function. 
We define also the mode of simulation we want to perform:
  -Mode1: in this mode we run a campaign based simulation 
  -Mode2: in this mode we run a campaign less simulation
2: Simulator.py: this is the main file that we run after we define our parameters in configuration file. In which we do the following:
